## 🚀 Quick start

This project uses Netlify Dev. Start development with `npm start`. Typescript can be used optionally.

## 🧐 What's inside?

- `src` is your general source files for this build. This includes all Gatsby's default file folders.
- `src/templates` is where Gatsby will look for file templates to match the ingested data.
- `functions` contains the Netlify handler to power server-less Lambda functions.
- `server` gives you the Appsby framework directly to build server-less endpoints easily.

## 🔨 Development

- Environment variables can be set for Netlify Dev via the Netlify dashboard (and the `toml` file - for context-specific variables).

## 💫 Deploy

Deploys are via Netlify, and should have branch deploys enabled.
You can access current branches with ${branchName}--${website}.netlify.app.
